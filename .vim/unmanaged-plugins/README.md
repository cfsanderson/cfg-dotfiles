# Unmanaged Plugins

These plugins are not managed by [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

## Gruvbox Material

This is a forked version of [sainnhe/gruvbox-material](https://github.com/sainnhe/gruvbox-material).

The main alterations are the main background (body) and foreground (paragraph/body plain text) colors.

I've followed the manual install recommends in the README.md by symlinking the correct files in this repo to the recommended locations in `./vim/autoload` and loading it into my `.vimrc` using vim-plug.
